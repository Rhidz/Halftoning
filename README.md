Halftoning is a technique used in printing and image processing to reproduce continuous-tone images using limited sets of discrete tones or colors. It is primarily used when reproducing images with grayscale or full-color content on devices that are only capable of producing binary or limited color output, such as black-and-white printers or newspaper presses.

The goal of halftoning is to simulate the appearance of shades of gray or different colors by varying the density or arrangement of small dots or patterns. These dots or patterns, called halftone dots, are typically of equal size but vary in their spacing or placement. When viewed from a distance, the human eye perceives the arrangement of dots as different shades or colors.
